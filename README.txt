Autoencoder encoding MNIST digits to 2 dimension latent space. This space is then visualized under images by label to show clustering of similar digits. Current reconstruction accuracy also shown under images.
Future idea: sampling latent space to generate a greater variety of digits -> viable method to generate data?

CGAN to generate images of MNIST Fashion dataset.
